When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my files or work from many devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may have my local versions of files and do may not want to merge changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork clones repository on the GitHub server.
	Clone clones local to local or remote to local repository.
	Branch branches local repository.
	Fork can be used on the server instead of branching locally. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can work on shared version off-line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    The collaboration process would be as follows:
	1. Clone master branch of a project from the remote repository into my computer
	2. Work with files and commit changes locally
	3. Push local changes to the GitHub repository and resolve possible conflicts

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
